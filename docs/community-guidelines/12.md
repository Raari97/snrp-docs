# 12. Criminal Groups (Orgs/Factions/Crews)

All clubs, gangs, organizations, factions, mafias, etc., have to be **approved** by the staff team.

If you want to join one of the pre-approved orgs, please contact them directly.

However, if you want to run a criminal organization, you must join the crews system and have members dongled onto the crew.

<!-- **If part of any of the above, the** [**organization rules**](../../criminal-groups-guidelines/organizations/), [**crew rules**](../../criminal-groups-guidelines/crews/), **and** [**faction rules**](../../criminal-groups-guidelines/factions/guidelines.md) **apply to you.** -->

:::warning Explanation

We would rather have 5 orgs with 20 people in them than 20 orgs with 5 people in them. This means you should try joining a pre-existing org first before applying to create your own. To run an org, you must be whitelisted.
