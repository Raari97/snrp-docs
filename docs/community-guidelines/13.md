# 13. No Mic, No Play

We require all members to use a microphone when playing in the city. Your microphone should be clear and either on push-to-talk or have no echo. Staff may require you to attempt to fix your microphone before allowing you to roleplay.

:::warning

If you have a reasonable explanation as to why you cannot use a microphone, please create a ticket on the forums detailing why this is the case, and an exemption may be made for you. (This can include cases where you are unable to physically talk.)
