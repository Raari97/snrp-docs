# 14. Roleplaying Injuries

If you get shot, are involved in a crash wherein a script triggers and downs you, fall from a high place, or do one of the many things that could get you hurt, you are required to roleplay these injuries out in a fair and reasonable manner.

---

:::warning

This means anytime a script triggers that does damage to you, states you are injured, blacks out your screen, or otherwise affects you.

:::

---

You need to roleplay your injuries with Emergency Services when they arrive on the scene. Stating, "I need a revive" or "just get me up" is not acceptable. You should also not mislead the Emergency Services about what injuries your character sustained.

---

:::info

If you are downed and can press **E** to respawn, you are permitted to do so.
