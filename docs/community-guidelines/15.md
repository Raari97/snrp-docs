# 15. No Discrimination

Our community is built on respect and inclusiveness for people from all walks of life. Do not make any discriminatory remarks about someone's race, gender, gender identity, sexual preference, health issues, or disability.

Just because we missed a category of discrimination here does not mean you cannot or will not be punished for it in-game.

We may also punish you for supporting someone else's act of discrimination. Staff will have the final word on whether a reasonable person should have known their actions were inappropriate.
