# 3. Community Etiquette

Do not advertise your own gaming communities, servers or other similar things without first seeking permission from an Admin. Always feel free to ask, the worst that will happen is you get told no. If you have a role that shows up on the discord sidebar above regular members, please note we may temporarily remove your discord role if your active status shows another server or group. It will be returned to you afterwards (you can also disable this discord feature entirely via the discord settings)
