# Age Restrictions

No character can be under the age of 18 without Admin permission. The server also has an expectation that everyone will act with maturity expected of an adult. Failure to do so may see you removed from the server for being underage/not mature enough.

Beyond what's written above, there is no real-life age restriction to play on SuperNova Roleplay.
