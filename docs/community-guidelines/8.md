# 8. Driving / Vehicle Rules

## 🚗 Driving Realism

Driving must be kept somewhat realistic. You should avoid driving vehicles in buildings. If your driving causes our crash script to trigger or your car is broken/disabled in a crash, you are expected to roleplay out the damage to your vehicle and your character. If, however, this does not occur, you can continue to drive as normal.

## 🏎️ Special Vehicles

Drag and Sprint Vehicles are not to be driven on the roads and can only be used on dedicated race tracks or during preplanned and staff-approved events.

---

## 👥 Vehicle Carry Capacity

You cannot use `/carry` if you are the driver of a vehicle—all your hands must be on the wheel to drive. **No Exemptions.** You cannot use `/carry` while on a motorcycle of any kind regardless of what seat you are in. In all cases, you can have as many people in a vehicle as there are usable seats **+1 person being carried.** You can ALSO have one additional person in the boot.

## 🚁 Appropriate Vehicles

There is to be no use of helicopters, planes, or other aerial vehicles unless you are doing so as part of your emergency service duties (HEMS, POLAIR, or Firehawk) or work for a licensed air transit company (approved by admins). 

If you need an aerial vehicle for a roleplay, please contact an admin (not a mod, CAT, or dev) and wait for confirmation. If there is any doubt as to whether you have permission, **DO NOT** use an aerial vehicle. 

This rule also applies to tanks, APCs, or other “special” vehicles that you would not normally be able to drive/pilot as a regular citizen in Victoria.
