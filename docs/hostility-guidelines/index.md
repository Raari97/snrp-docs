:::info Overview
Hostility is a tool to support story-driven roleplay — not the main attraction. Use it thoughtfully, escalate fairly, and always aim to create enjoyable experiences for everyone involved.
:::

:::tip Quick reference
- Conflicts last a maximum of <strong>5 days</strong> (extensions require staff approval)
- Death cooldown: <strong>1 hour</strong> (check with <code>/lastDeath</code>)
- Group-to-group conflicts must be <strong>flagged in the Crew App</strong>

## Intent and Overall Direction for Hostile RP

SuperNova RP is not a “fragging” server. Hostility should serve as a mechanism to enhance roleplay rather than the primary source of entertainment. Hostile actions must align with our established framework, providing immersive and balanced roleplay.

- **Applies to**: Player-to-Player, Group-to-Group, Group-to-Police
- **Always consider impact**: Repeated hostile interactions that diminish enjoyment for others may lead to exclusion from events and systems.
- **Escalation**: Must be logical, proportionate, and fair. Continuous or excessive escalation beyond reasonable RP boundaries may lead to staff intervention.

:::note
Our community thrives on meaningful roleplay experiences. Hostility should move the story forward, not stall it.

## Hostility Term Limits

### Conflict Duration

- **One-and-done** conflicts are acceptable when all parties agree; you’re not obliged to maintain hostility beyond a single encounter.
- **Maximum duration**: Conflicts may last up to five (5) days. Resolution is assumed after five days unless an extension request is approved by staff.

### RDM and RP Basis

:::caution RDM rules apply
You must have a valid RP reason for any attack. Ongoing conflicts can provide that RP reason. Outside of conflict, initiating combat without proper RP is RDM.
:::

### Death Cooldown

:::note Death cooldown
There is a <strong>mandatory one‑hour cooldown</strong> after a character’s death before rejoining hostile activities. Use <code>/lastDeath</code> to track cooldowns. Cooldowns reset upon server restarts.
:::

### Group-to-Group Flagging

:::info Flag your conflict
For group‑to‑group hostility, <strong>flag the conflict in the Crew App on the Tablet</strong>.

## Guidance Before Violence and Example Scenarios

Hostile RP should be preceded by meaningful interactions such as warnings, negotiations, or demands. Going straight to shooting without RP build‑up is considered poor roleplay.

:::tip Good example
You confront a rival group about a disputed territory, exchange warnings, attempt to negotiate, and only resort to violence when negotiations fail.
:::

:::danger Bad example
You see a rival group and immediately open fire without any RP or context.
:::

- **Offer choices**: Provide demands and opportunities to comply before escalating to lethal force.
- **Let others respond**: Always give the other party a chance to react in-character.

---

## Kidnapping Guidelines

:::danger Prohibited
- Humiliation or inappropriate roleplay
- Kidnapping police or civilians for ransoms (power gaming)
:::

:::tip Purpose and allowed use
Kidnapping must serve a clear RP purpose — primarily leverage in negotiations or structured conflict. You may kidnap for leverage in hostile situations with police, but responses will vary by situation.
:::

### Ransom Procedure

1. Upon kidnapping, **immediately attempt** to contact a member of the opposing group to negotiate a ransom.
2. **Holding time**: Hostages may not be held longer than 20 minutes without successful contact. After contact, that group has an additional 20 minutes to arrange payment or alternatives.
3. **Debt arrangements**: If unable to pay immediately, a documented debt arrangement may be established, requiring payment within 7 days. Failure to repay may result in staff intervention, payment enforcement, and potential disciplinary action.

### Ransom Limits

| Rank | Maximum Ransom Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Member | $5,000 Dirty Money |
| Manager / 2IC | $10,000 Dirty Money |
| Leader | $15,000 Dirty Money |

### Daily Kidnapping Limits

:::caution Daily limits
- Maximum of <strong>2 kidnappings per group per day</strong>
- Only <strong>1 per victim group per day</strong>
- All kidnappings require a <strong>pre‑existing conflict</strong>
:::

---

## Group Limits

:::info Participant caps
- Unaffiliated / Unregistered crews: <strong>Max 5</strong>
- Registered crews: Must adhere to registered max. If registered for 7 but only 6 are available, you may not substitute external players.
- If continuing with an external member, you must revert to the <strong>unregistered limit (5)</strong>.
:::

### Groups sharing a common hostile objective

:::caution Coordination rules
- **No joint operations**: Direct collaboration on hostile actions between groups is prohibited.
- **Independent action allowed**: You may notify another group of your intent, but they must decide and execute independently without detailed coordination.
:::

## Group to Police Interactions

### General Principles

- **Criminals set the tone**: Police react proportionately to the level of hostility shown by criminals.
- **Non‑lethal → lighter response**; **lethal → coordinated, heavily armed response**.
- **Escalating against police is escalating against the entire force**; expect a unified response.
- **Police are infinitely resourced for RP purposes** and will always, eventually, prevail.
- **Winning a fight ≠ winning the war**: You may win encounters, but you cannot defeat police in the long term.
- These interactions should **drive meaningful storylines**, not be shortcuts to mass shootouts.
- Consider the wider player base — **tying up the entire police force unnecessarily** can stall other RP opportunities.


### Avoiding Forced Escalation
- Using hostility as an “easy way out” (e.g., turning car boost into a shootout instead of finishing the pursuit because it is the easier option) is generally frowned upon. Groups and players engaging in this type of roleplay may be excluded from progression systems.
- Commit to the style of engagement you initiate — if you start a pursuit, focus on escape rather than forcing combat without cause.


### Before Hostility
- Build meaningful RP before escalating — use threats, negotiations, diversions, or other in‑character interactions first.
- Avoid baiting police purely for combat; provide a narrative hook that justifies the encounter.

### During Hostility

- Keep engagements **proportional and balanced** to the situation.
- If you escalate, understand you are **choosing** the scale of the police response.
- Avoid prolonging engagements without RP purpose — stalling purely to tie up police resources is poor roleplay.

### After Hostility

- Follow through on RP consequences such as arrests, injury roleplay, and investigations.
- Consider future implications — repeated high‑hostility engagements will cause police to treat your group as a high‑risk target.
